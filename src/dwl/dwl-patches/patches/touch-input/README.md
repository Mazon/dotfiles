### Description
Adds touchscreen functionality.

KNOWN BUGS:
- Sometimes, the pointer moves to where the screen is pressed, but the button press doesn't occur until the screen is touched AGAIN. This means that if you touch to click button 'Q' on the screen (for instance), nothing happens; then you touch elsewhere on the screen and THEN button 'Q' registers a click. This is annoying, doesn't always happen, and I don't yet know how to fix it.
